# Simple-command-command-line
This is a command line game I made in one day, it is buggy and only barely not crashes. I shouldn't

INSTRUCTIONS:
to move first specify direction by either using N, S, W, E. (Which represents north, south west east)
After that specify the number of blocks to move (either 1 or 2)
It's 10 x 10
